        <div class='header'><h1>AMZN Trade Note</h1></div>
        <div class='section'><h2>Investment Memo</h2><div class='ai-commentary'>**1. Executive Summary:**

The investment thesis for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) presents a mixed picture, with the key concern being a significant overvaluation as per the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. While the company exhibits a strong gross margin and a moderate leverage position, the deteriorating Return on Equity (ROE) and Asset Turnover indicate efficiency issues. Considering the current financial health and valuation metrics, our recommendation is to SELL.

**2. Business Overview:**

Amazon.com, Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is one of the world's most valuable companies and is considered one of the Big Five in the U.S. information technology industry, alongside Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft.

**3. Financial Health Analysis:**

Amazon's gross margin is 50.0%, an improving trend, indicating the company's efficient cost management. However, the ROE is deteriorating at 20.7%, raising concerns about the company’s profitability relative to shareholder equity. The Asset Turnover ratio, measuring the company's ability to generate sales from its assets, is also deteriorating at 1.02. This may suggest lower efficiency in generating revenue from its assets. On the leverage front, Amazon's Debt-to-Equity ratio is 0.46, an improving trend, implying a moderate level of financial risk. The Altman Z-Score is in the safe zone, further confirming the company's lower bankruptcy risk.

**4. Valuation Assessment:**

The DCF model indicates that Amazon is significantly overvalued. The fair value per share is $129.68, while the current market price is $239.30, implying a downside of 45.8%. This suggests that the stock’s current price does not reflect its intrinsic value, presenting an investment risk. On a relative valuation basis, Amazon’s P/E ratio of 34.14 is higher than the peer median of 23.16, but below the dynamic red-line threshold of 34.74, suggesting it's not extremely overvalued compared to its peers.

**5. Investment Risks:**

The primary investment risk is Amazon's overvaluation as per the DCF model. In addition, the deteriorating ROE and Asset Turnover ratio suggest operational inefficiencies that could impact future profitability. The company also faces intense competition and regulatory scrutiny, which are common sector-level risks.

**6. Final Verdict:**

Given the significant overvaluation per the DCF model and operational efficiency issues, as indicated by the falling ROE and Asset Turnover, we recommend a SELL for Amazon. The current market price does not seem to reflect the company’s intrinsic value, implying a potential downside risk. Despite the company's improving gross margin and moderate leverage, these factors do not sufficiently offset the valuation and operational concerns.</div></div>
