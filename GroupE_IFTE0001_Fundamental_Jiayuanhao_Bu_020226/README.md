# Fundamental Analyst Agent (AMZN)

This project implements an AI-powered **fundamental equity analysis agent** that ingests
company financial statements, computes key financial ratios, performs valuation
(P/E screening and DCF), and generates a concise **investment memo** together with
a structured HTML report.

The agent is designed to replicate the workflow of a **fundamental equity analyst**,
focusing on financial interpretation and valuation reasoning rather than trading
or backtesting strategies.

---

## 1. Agent Overview

The objective of this agent is to automate key components of fundamental analysis,
including financial statement interpretation, ratio analysis, valuation screening,
and risk assessment.

The agent emphasises:
- Profitability, leverage, and efficiency analysis  
- Market-based valuation using relative multiples  
- Intrinsic valuation using a simplified, data-driven DCF framework  
- Interpretable, text-based investment reasoning  

All outputs are generated automatically and can be reproduced using a single
execution script.

## 2. Agent Design and Workflow

The agent follows the workflow below:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Retrieves historical Income Statement and Balance Sheet data
   - Covers multiple fiscal years plus trailing twelve months (TTM)

2. **Financial Ratio Analysis**
   - Gross Margin (profitability)
   - Return on Equity (ROE)
   - Debt-to-Equity Ratio (leverage)
   - Asset Turnover (operational efficiency)

3. **Financial Risk Assessment**
   - Computes the Altman Z-score
   - Classifies financial risk into standard risk zones

4. **Valuation Analysis**
   - Relative valuation using the P/E ratio with a dynamic red-line threshold
   - Peer group constructed from Consumer Cyclical comparables
   - Intrinsic valuation using a minimal, data-driven DCF model
   - **Sanity check between intrinsic valuation (DCF) and market-implied valuation**

5. **Report Generation**
   - Generates a concise investment memo (Markdown)
   - Produces a structured HTML report summarising key findings

## 4. Key Outputs

After running the agent, the following outputs are generated in the `reports/` folder:

- `AMZN_investment_memo.md`  
  → A text-based investment memo explaining profitability, risk, and valuation considerations

- `AMZN_ai_agent_report.html`  
  → A structured HTML report presenting financial statements, ratios, risk metrics,
    and valuation summaries

Additional CSV files are also generated to support transparency and reproducibility
of computed ratios and valuation inputs.

---

## 5. How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the agent:
```bash
python run_demo.py
```

3. Open the generated reports in the `reports/` folder.

## 6. Strategy Logic

The agent does not implement an explicit trading strategy. Instead, it applies a
**fundamental analysis logic** to assess the firm’s financial health and valuation
position.

The strategy logic consists of:
- Identifying profitability trends through margin and ROE analysis
- Assessing financial risk using leverage ratios and Altman Z-score
- Evaluating valuation risk via P/E screening
- Cross-checking intrinsic valuation (DCF) against current market valuation

This logic supports investment reasoning rather than direct buy/sell signals.

---

## 7. Outputs & Interpretation

The outputs generated by the agent are intended to support interpretation rather
than mechanical decision-making.

- Financial ratios provide insight into operating performance and efficiency
- Risk metrics highlight potential financial distress or balance-sheet strength
- Valuation outputs indicate whether current market pricing appears reasonable
  relative to fundamentals

The investment memo integrates these signals into a coherent analytical narrative.

## 8. Intended Use

This project is intended for **educational purposes** and demonstrates how an
AI agent can support structured fundamental analysis and investment reasoning.
