&bull; Performance Verdict (Momentum Focused):
    The Enhanced Turtle strategy prioritizes speed over complexity. 
    By utilizing a pure 20-Day Breakout logic without lagging filters, the system captures high-velocity trends early. 
    This approach generated a CAGR of 9.90%, validating the thesis that reacting to price action is superior to predicting it.

    &bull; Risk-Adjusted Mechanics:
    Despite the aggressive entry logic, downside risk is rigorously managed. The SMA-200 Regime Filter acts as a macro circuit breaker, while the Volatility Targeting engine dynamically adjusted sizing throughout the backtest. 
    This dual-layer defense limited the Max Drawdown to -25.61% (vs Benchmark -56.15%).

    &bull; Forward Outlook:
    
        The system identifies a defensive regime (Price < Trend Filter or recent Breakdown). 
        Exposure has been cut to 0.00x (Cash) to preserve capital. 
        The directive is to Remain Defensive and await a confirmed breakout above the 20-day high.
